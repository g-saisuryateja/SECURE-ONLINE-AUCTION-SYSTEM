# SECURE-ONLINE-AUCTION-SYSTEM

In this project, an online
auction system is being implemented in python using streamlit. In order to ensure the userâ€™s
safety, the password of each user is encrypted using symmetric encryption and then stored
to the database.
This project is an online auction initiative that hosts online auctions for a variety of products on a website and provides services to both sellers and buyers. Users can set up auctions for their products, and buyers can register and bid on the various products or goods offered for bidding.

Secure Online Auction System Project consists of the following parts:

Home: This is the welcome page which contains directions for the other options.

Sign up: This is used to create new account, either a buyer account or seller account.

Seller Login: After logging into their account, the seller can upload the product which they are willing to sell along with the minimum bidding price.

Buyer Login: After logging into their account, the buyer can view a list of products that are up for auction and place a bid on one of them.

Admin Login: This is only for administrator for maintains.
